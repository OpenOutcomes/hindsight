# Reasons

A taxonomy of reasons is used to capture people's hopes, fulfillments, and reflections (which are recorded as reason-associated  [Timelines](Timeline.md).

Reasons have at least a name, id, and type. To help with autocomplete suggestions, reasons may also have aliases, hyponyms, hypernyms, and payoffs.


## Types of reasons

There are two main types of reasons:  experiences and furtherances.  In other words, someone uses a website or app or visits a location because either there is something they want to experience there or some other goal or value that the use or visit furthers.

Experiences may be feelings (feel happy, feel relaxed, etc), activations of our human potential (get creative, be bold, be of service), or simple activities (skiing, coding, making music).

Furtherances may be physical infrastructure for the good life (a car, a home, a ukulele), social relationships (a lover, a friend, a mentor), personal capacities (courage, ability to love).

We need to separate experiences and furtherances because we have different followup questions for each.  Asking the user if they had an experience is different than asking them if their goals were achieved.


## Autocomplete metadata

We use additional metadata to recognize what the user types and guide them to specify their reasons using the most relatable and powerful terms.

* We use aliases (chilling = feeling relaxing) to merge identical terms.
* We use hyponyms and hypernyms to keep users from being too specific or too vague (planning potlucks => planning group gatherings).  
* And we use payoffs to help users find the particular furtherance they're looking for (sex => a lover).
