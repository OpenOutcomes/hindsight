- integrate tokenfield (below)
- design firebase stores for migration data

---


- integrate http://sliptree.github.io/bootstrap-tokenfield/
- make a tokenview that can ask for just activities, outcomes, ethics, autocomplete, and takes a callback for reporting the data into firebase
- figure out where to stash the migration data in firebase


MIGRATIONS TO STORE
  - within outcome
    - activity migration
    - resource migration
  - within activity
    - best for getting started
  - activity to activity, irrespective of outcomes (??)
  - outcome to outcome
  - ethic to ethic

----

activity, bad:
  - other activity for same goals?

activity, good:
  - another product helped you get started?

outcome, bad:
  - are you still into this outcome?
    y:
      - another activity has helped?
      - another resource has helped?
    n:
      - what outcomes are more important to you now?

outcome, good:
  "yay!"

ethic, good:
  "Yay!"

ethic bad:
  - are you still into this ethic?
    y:
      - text string? "what have you learned?"
    n:
      - new ethics?
