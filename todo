GET TAG EDITORS AND LISTS WORKING ON LIVE FIREBASE DATA

- design fb datamodel (... for now, just like what's in js)
- switch lists to be fblists
- add buttons work to add activity
- add button works to add goals in both editors

------------------------------------------------

ADD IN TYPEAHEAD TEXTFIELDS TO EDITORS

- copy typeahead stuff into batshit
- figure out where the data for all values and all activities will live

------------------------------------------------

- fn to merge suggested tags and user settings to get a data structure like the above

------------------------------------------------

real data
- data model includes popular outcomes for each common activity
- user input data model with outcomes and freq per activity, choice values, activities confirmed, etc
- batshit firepaint can change path


polish
- range slider updates text value for frequences
- get rid of tabs in favor of some kind of "add yours" thing and rest of review in modal
- start incorporating css from review.css
- render checkmarks before confirmed tags
- disappear tags on "no"
- update and redraw user structure as yes/no buttons in editor are clicked
