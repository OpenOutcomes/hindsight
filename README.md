hindsight
=========

Code for the chrome extension demo'd in http://nxhx.org/maximizing/, also in the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hindsight/accbpganjjaadepnncaknjdkogbmgfbl).


## Welcome to the code

Your best bet is just to look inside `background.jsx`.  Mostly it's just calls out to other npm modules, chrome-activities and reasons.


## Getting started

* `npm install`
* `npm run build`
* Load in chrome as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

To rebuild continuously, `npm run watch`.
