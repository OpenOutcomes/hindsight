=======

a set of widgets for annotating choices on the web such that they become fair and expressive choices by incorporating social information about outcomes and costs and underlying values

see the "Fair Choices, Expressive Choices" paper http://nxhx.org/InformedChoice/

Here are pickers, editors, and inspectors for various data types.

### Goods

Why you use a particular thing.  Possibly an ongoing goal you have, i.e., a reason for multiple engagements.

Things that happened during a particular interaction with a resource.  Like maybe you paid for it and you've visited it once a week.  Includes what your reasons were, and whether they worked out for you.


### Observations


### Resources

Websites, products, venues... anything you use or engage with.
